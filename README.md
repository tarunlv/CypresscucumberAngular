# AngularBase

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 22.1.7.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
npm run e2e
```

Cypress and Cucumber are configured. Run either `npm run e2e` or `npm run e2e:run`. Both commands start Angular on port 4300, run the feature scenarios in Chrome, and stop the server afterward.

For interactive testing, run `npm run start -- --port 4300` in one terminal and `npm run e2e:open` in another. The internal `npm run cypress:run` command expects an already-running server and is mainly used by the automated E2E scripts.

Place feature files under `cypress/e2e/` and colocate their steps using matching names, such as `dashboard-navigation.feature` and `dashboard-navigation.steps.ts`. Shared steps belong in `cypress/support/step_definitions/`.

Run unit tests with `npm test`, or include coverage with `npm run test:coverage`.
